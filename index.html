      <h3> Visualization Critique 2 - Matthew Caruso</h3>
      <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2016/04/14/every-kobe-bryant-shot-charted/"> Every Shot Ever Taken By Kobe Bryant </a>
      <p> One very interesting visualization that caught my eye was the visualization for the data presented on how every shot Kobe Bryant took throughout his 20 year career in the NBA. Throughout Kobe Bryant's 20 season career as a Los Angeles Laker it was recorded that he has taken 30,699 shots, which is an absurb amount of shots. I found this visualization on FlowingData.com and had many concerns on how they presented this data. For instense, I thought it was very confusing to understand because of how much data there is and how clustered the map was. After looking into this data set in more detail, I did find it very interesting that something like this could ever been recorded properly. </p>
      <p> One of the aspects of the map that I found very interesting and very useful was how exact each shot was recorded. On this map you are able to click on different spots that they have marked down and it goes crazy details like what day the shot was taken and even time that shot was taken against. You are also able to see on the map where Kobe Bryant made a majority of his shots throughout his career and it even breaks it down into percentage on how often Kobe Bryant would have made that particular shot. There are also other very interesting sets of data recorded on this made such as the very first field goal Kobe Bryant made and what day he made this shot on. Each shot is color coated to express wether he made it or not and how important certain shots were depending on the game. I could imagine that this visualization might be something the Laker's organization can use to express how valuable Kobe Bryant was to there organization and might be fun to look into for a die hard Kobe fan.</p>

    <h3> Assignment - Visualization Critique 1 </h3>
    <a href= "http://googletrends.github.io/iframe-scaffolder/#/view?urls=Thanksgiving%202015%7Chttps:%252F%252Fgoogledataorg.cartodb.com%252Fu%252Fgoogledata%252Fviz%252Fbf595f4c-7381-11e5-9ec5-42010a14800c%252Fembed_map&active=0&sharing=1&autoplay=0&loop=1&layout=narrative&theme=red&title=A%20day%20in%20the%20life:%20US%20Thanksgiving%20on%20Google%20Flights&description=The%20day%20before%20Thanksgiving%202015%20shown%20in%20US%20domestic%20and%20international%20air%20travel%20booked%20with%20Google%20Flights" > Google Thanksgiving Flights </a>
    <p> One visualization that I found online was a map generated by Google to show the amount of people that were flying around the United States on Thanksgiving. The data is represented in a torque map and shows different airlanes color coded flying across the United States. I thought this was very interesting and effective why to display this data set because it shows were these flights are taking off and were they are landing. </p>
    <p> A map like this can show you how diverse the United States is and how someone can have family members living across the country. This map also shows flights leaving the United States and going overseas into different countries as well and this information is very useful because it shows you what types of airlines actually travel overseas. I was very impressed with how this data was represented in this map and I thought this map made it very easy to understand where certain airline companies fly and it was also very interesting to see where their final destination will be. </p>

      <h3> Visualization Critique 3 - Yvonne Knoepfel</h3>
      <a href="http://americanredcross.github.io/guinea-swipe/?americanredcross.fy5019k9&osm/#16/8.5457/-9.4700" target="_blank"> Mapping of Ebola affected cities in Guinea</a> 
      <p> For my third visualization critique, I used an example of OpenStreetMap.  As stated on the website, 
      <blockquote>These maps show ebola affected cities in Guinea as they appeared in OpenStreetMap before and after the activation of Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) volunteers. Volunteers used free satellite imagery from the US State Department, Mapbox, Microsoft Bing and Astrium to identify and "trace" features (roads, buildings, rivers) into the map. Over 700 volunteers created over 4.3 million objects, and almost 10,000 points of interest, 7,500 places and 350,000 buildings over a 5 month period. They also mapped place names submitted by Doctors Without Borders, the roads connecting these cities and the residential "footprints" of surrounding towns and villages. Most cities took between 24 and 48 hours to completely map, with many locations being traced simultaneously.</blockquote> </p>
      <p>By clicking and dragging the slider along the bar to swipe between the maps, one can see the map of Macenta before the activation of the volunteers and afterwards. I think this map is highly useful in emergency situations, as many people on the ground are able to reflect the situation and any changes to it immediately. For example, one could imagine that there are blocked roads in zones of high Ebola infection. However, a legend explaining the different colors used for the streets would be useful, and I could also imagine adding more information to it such as displaying the actual pockets of Ebola/affected areas, as well as hospitals or availability of treatment. </p>

      <h3>Visualization Critique 3: Hydro Hierarchy - Megan Hubel</h3>
      <p>This <a href = "http://maps.esri.com/rc/radial/index.html">interactive map</a>  hosted by ESRI (authored by Richie Carmichael) shows the connectivity of the major river systems in the US and average water flows of those systems for 2014. This map is particularly effective because of its non-traditional layout; all of the typical political boundaries and labels have been removed, and the black background with bright, neon colors on top lets the user focus solely on the river networks.</p>
      <p>The other noteworthy features of this map are the interactive graphs to the left-hand side of the chart. The bar chart shows monthly average flow for the highlighted river, and the horizontal red line indicates the ten-month average flow for that river. When comparing the ten-month benchmark against monthly averages, it becomes apparent that in most months water flow falls below the benchmark, with a likely volume spike above the benchmark for one or two months in the springtime. The radial diagram to the left explains river hierarchy and relative size of the overall network compared to other networks. </p>

      <h3>Project 3 Project: Volkswagens - Megan Hubel </h3>
      <p>In light of the recent Volkswagen scandal, I attempted to map the number of recalled Volkswagen automobiles based in the US. Finding a dataset that contained this information was a challenge, but I was able to find vehicular dataset of roughly 37,000 cars through the US Government’s department of energy, that included make and model per car. Of the 37,000 records, about a third included state registration.  Of the 11,000 records with state registration, about 500 were Volkswagen cars. By matching car model and year, I identified 46 faulty Volkswagens. I then mapped the percent of recalled Volkswagens out of the state-level VW population. </p>

      <h3>Visualization Critique 3 - Doh Y Jung</h3>
        <p>There was a lot of coverage around hurriacne Joaquin earlier this week, which got me worried. But fortunately, according to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/01/us/hurricane-joaquin-map.html" target="_blank">this map</a>, it seems like we'll be alright!</p>
        <p>The map is visualizing hurricane Joaquins path. It's using both colors and the size of the circle to represent the strength (or the predicted strength) of the storm. Position of the cirlce also indicates the location and the larger differently shaded regioon seems to represent eitehr margin of error for the location prediction or larger imapcted region from the hurricane.</p>
        <p>In the backend, it is reading in a live-updating <a href="http://int.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2015/20150930-hurricane-joaquin/latest/latest-v2.json" target="_blank">json file</a>, which are updating based on the data from National Weather Service. It seems to also be making connections to the Google API for basemaps and other visualziations.</p>
        <p>Overall I felt that this map is doing its job properly. Most of the information was well labeled. Data was available for peoeple to investigate. No Flash. Snappy!</p>

      <h3>Project 3: Median Household Income by State - Doh Y Jung</h3>
      <p>I already did layering of two different data types last week (tweets and earthquakes), so instead I wanted to try my hands on more custom cartodb features. I downloaded the shapefile from Andrew Hill's blogpost. The data was originally showing a state by state heatmap of bee populations. I also downlaoded the state median household data from wikipedia and uploaded to cartodb. And using the same shape file, I merged the state-by-state median household income data, this time directly from cartodb, to visualize the following heatmap.</p>

      <h3>Project 3 - Angelo Jack</h3>
      <p>I quickly attempted to map some US gun crime data given what was going on in the news. Found it curiously interesting to discover that the CDC is currently banned from collection gunshot data. Gunshot wounds are a health concern in my opinion. The data came from The Guardian news site.</p>

      <h3>Visualization Critique 3 - Angelo Jack</h3>
      <p> I found this visualization to be quite interesting. The pulsing nature of the movements and sound caught my attention. To see how humans through the environment, not to mention the number of people on the move, is very interesting to me. The designer was able to do so much with just the use of two colors (plus sound) to tell the story.</p>

      <h3>Project 3 - Andrew Hayias</h3>
      <p>For my visualization, I took water quality complaints throughout New York City and overlaid them over NYCHA housing developments. I used red caution symbols to visualize the water complaints and shaded the NYCHA developments as blue. I also used the dark matter CartoDB basemap to make them stand out. You can click on each complaint and see the address and a description of the complaint. I had wanted to see if water complaints were more concentrated around NYCHA developments. While it does seem that public housing has its fair share of water complaints, they appear to be well distributed around New York City.</p>

      <h3>Visualization Critique 3 - Andrew Hayias</h3>
      <p>For my visualization critique, I used the Guardian's visualization of the 994 mass shootings that took place in America in 1,004 days. The guardian used data from <a href="http://shootingtracker.com/wiki/Main_Page">the Mass Shooting Tracker</a>,which cites all known mass shootings since 2013 in the United States. They define a mass shooting as four or more people shot in one "spree" or setting. This is actually different than the FBI's definition, which would only count the event as a mass shooting if four people were murdered.</p>
      <p>This is a powerful visualization, showing the location and date of each shooting, along with individual icons for each person killed (red) or wounded (yellow). I feel that by listing each event separately, it does its best visualize the not only the human cost, but how regular these events seem to occur in the United States.  Perhaps one addition to the visualization could be a news link for each shooting or a list of the names of the victims.</p>

      <h3>Project 3: How Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Distorts the Market for Grocers - Allen Shaibani</h3>
      <p><b>Hypothesis:</b> The <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program">Supplemental Nurtition Assistance Program (SNAP)</a>, commonly referred to as 'food stamps' encourages an inelastic market place for grocery stores.</p>
      <p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federal aid program that provides food purchasing assistance for low and no income people living in the United States.</p>
      <p><b>Method:</b> SNAP recipients and their relation to their community district were to be juxtaposed to the average prices of groceries within the respecting district.</p>
      <p><b>Data: </b> Grocery prices were obtained on-site from multiple locations of the same grocer, assuming that the rest of the locations have the same prices. </p>
      <iframe width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" src="https://jaramana.cartodb.com/viz/1ddcfc98-659c-11e5-9166-0e5b35a699a7/embed_map" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p><b>Results: </b> After the data was compiled and collocated, a regression analysis was conducted. A regression analysis of the percentage of community districts on SNAP and the average grocery prices in those respecting community districts yielded in a low correlation coefficient (Multiple R =<b> 0.161</b>). (A high score represents a greater correlation, the limit being 1). <b>Thus, <i>SNAP use has no to very little relation with grocery prices.</i></b></p>
      <p><i>Post Script:</i> Median household income was obtained to show that perhaps there is a relation between income and grocery prices. A regression analysis resulted in a moderate correlation coefficient (Multiple R=<b> 0.488</b>). This indicated a casual relation between the two data sets.</p>

      <a href="http://www.ny4p.org/research/ccd-profiles" target="_blank">New Yorkers for Parks</a> 
      <p>This week I received an email from New Yorkers For Parks. The email had a link to a web page, which was broken up by the cities council districts. I really like the layout of the page. It’s kind of confussing to figure out which district you live or work in,  so there is a link to search for your district.</p>
      <p>Once you identify your district, you can just click the box which will then take you to a report for that council’s district. The map has a legend that is easy to follow. There is also a list of parks below that map. This is pretty handy information if you are new to a neighborhood, or maybe you are thinking of moving to a new neighborhood. A real estate agent would also find this information handy.</p>
      <p>The second page has some additional statistics that are pretty interesting.  There is also a list of contact information for the neighborhood along with a list of data sources.</p>
      <p>I would have liked to see a borough wide report or a table of comparisons with each of the districts listed. Overall, this has to be one of the better maps of a neighborhood that I have seen.</p>

      <p>For this weeks project, I mapped out rodent sightings as per 311 and restaurant letter grades as per the department of health for 2015. I was looking to see if there was a strong relationship between rat sightings and restaurant letter grades. I would assume that if there was a rat infestation in a neighborhood, it would be pretty hard for a restaurant to keep the rodents out.</p>
      <p>It was pretty easy to pull out the rodent data as it was already geocoded. I was surprised to see just how many calls came into 311 for rodents. The data set was huge, so I had to filter out just the data for the borough of Brooklyn. I did the same with the restaurant data set. I filtered out just the graded restaurants for Brooklyn. There were numerous restaurants that have not been graded or are still waiting to be graded. I then had to find the latitude and longitude for each restaurant. I did have a hard time with this, the data that I pulled back was not exact, each address seems to be a bock or two off.</p>
      <p>I did not see a strong correlation as there were rodents all over the borough. It looks like the rats really like Fulton Street. My results were also of because my restaurants were not precisely mapped.</p>

      <h3> Visualization Critique 2 - Jonah Bleckner</h3>
      <h3>Accidental Skyline</h3>
      <p>For my second visualization critique, I chose a CartoDB map that was produced by the Municipal Arts Society, entitled <a href= "http://www.mas.org/urbanplanning/accidental-skyline/"> "Accidental Skyline,"</a> in response to the proliferation of huge skyscrapers along the southern border of Central Park. This map has the potential to serve as a tool for the public to engage in the on-going and contentious debate about real estate development in the city.</p>
      <p>This map successfully allows users to make six different layers visible simultaneously. The first two layers illutrate the available Floor to Area Ratio (FAR) accross the five boroughs. Regions of the city with a high level of FAR availability (i.e. underused development rights) are considered extremely ripe for developers to build huge profitable building as-of-right. The map then allows users to see the spatial relationship between  the neighborhoods in NYC that are vulnerable to large scale developments, with the historic districts that are protected by the the Landmarks Preservation Committee. Other layers on this interactive map include: Parks, NYCHA's real estate portfolio, and the Subway Lines. One UX issue with this map is that you cannot easily compare the state of each borough; one is forced to look at each borough in isolation. However, the data visualization clearly communicates which areas of the city are likely to see massive redevelopments that are destructive to local communities.</p>

      <p> The reason I chose this map was because of how huge of a factor the zoning was throughout the entire process of legalization. It was the key debate for opponents and supporters alike of this new industry that ws bound to thrive; where can and can't recreational shops be allowed to open?</p>
      <p>
      What I appreciate about this map is the careful detail to zoning, precisely showing the areas where new store are allowed to open. In addition, the points on the map which indicate both current medicinal dispensaries and others which plan on expanding into the recreational industry. However, it is the lack of other factors, other points and polugons, which represent schools, day cares, and other points or areas of interest where legal shops are forbidden from opening, which take away from this map's greatest potential. Thus, it is more two-dimensional and does not tell the complte story. If anything, I am left more confused by the zoning. </p>

      <h3> Visualization Critique 1 - Zak Accuardi </h3>
      <a href="http://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/CyclePhilly/"> Cycle Philly </a> 
      <p> Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) is using a fun dataset gathered from the "Cycle Philly" app, which tracks users' cycling routes and prompts them to enter their trip purposes. This kind of data is valuable in transportation planning because it is hard to keep track of how many people actually use bike infrastructure, let alone why. Nonetheless this dataset is relatively incomplete just by virtue of the fact that it only represents the behaviors of 220 Philadelphia bike riders. To the mapmakers' credit, they acknowledge this clearly. </p>
      <p> The map's aesthetic is nice. The black background with bright colored lines seems like an industry standard at this point. It's a nice touch to distinguish between trip density along each corridor using both line width and color -- this map is trying to communicate one thing at a time and do it really clearly.  </p>
      <p> The interactive functionality is modest but informative, mostly allowing users to visualize frequent bike routes by specific trip purpose (by default, all trips are aggregated). It would be nice to be able to overlay different trip types to compare them more directly, or to add some additional contextual information, e.g. census demographics or even some of the major destinations that riders might be riding to and from. </p>

      <p> This article released on April 11, 2016 by the New York Times refers to a set of maps created by the National Park Service that showed amounts of ambient noise throughout the United States. The data was visualized quite well. The choropleth allowed for distinction between ranges of noise. The addition of the note distinguishing between the maps was definitely important to know in order to understand what the major takeaway should be from the maps. Though the map is missing titles, the legend helps the viewer understand what the map is showing.</p>

      <p> As stated on the National Park Service's site <a href=
      "http://www.nature.nps.gov/sound/soundmap.cfm"> Mapping Sound on a National Scale </a>, such maps are important because, 
      "http://www.nature.nps.gov/sound/soundmap.cfm"> Mapping Sound on a National Scale</a>, such maps are important because, 
      <blockquote>
      Park visitors and wildlife interact with each other and park resources through their senses, including the sense of hearing. So, protection of natural sounds is good for both ecosystems and the quality of visitor experience. Additionally, there are laws and policies that require the agency to conserve acoustic environments “unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."
      </blockquote>
      Mapping sound was a great way to bring awareness to the presence of sound in the environment. The story told by these maps are easy enough to understand whether the reader is a park official, a policymaker, or merely a resident of the United States.

      <p> The visualization reveals compelling takeaways regarding ambient noise, land use, and the natural environment. I found the amount of naturally-occurring ambient noise to be particularly surprising. Though it informs us that noise levels tend to be higher in areas with greater moisture and vegetation, it also shows the mere presence of people tends to result in greater ambient noise. The level of ambient noise only increases as the concentration of people increases, and ambient noise levels are particularly high in cities. I would be curious to see a pair of maps comparing ambient noise levels during the day to ambient noise levels at night.</p>
      <p> The source data set can be found at the <a href="https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2217356"> NPS Data Store</a>. This location is also home to other data sets and maps pertaining to observations such as Nighttime Lights and Wind Power Potential. This source could be an important one to explore in terms of understanding and facing challenges we may face in the future regarding land management.</p>

      <h3>Visualization Critique 1 - Jonah Bleckner</h3>
      <h3>The Rich Live Longer Everywhere. For the Poor, Geography Matters</h3>
      <p>For this assignment, I wanted to select and reflect upon a data visualization that has reached a large audience, and so for that reason I chose a recent interactive map that was published by the New York Times entitled, <a href= "http://nyti.ms/23nEYyr"> "Rich Live Longer Everywhere. For the Poor, Geography Matters." </a> (On the subreddit, "DataisBeautiful," this trending NYT map has been viewed 4,784 times.)</p>
      <p>This visualization maps the life expectancy of 40-year olds with household incomes below $28,000, adjusted for race. In other words, the author of this map wanted to illustrate that beyond income, geography has a significant effect on public health. I think that this simple visualization powerfully drives this point home, especially since it is evident that life expectancy is on average higher for those individuals that live in some of the wealthier American cities along the east and west coast. From a technical standpoint, I did have some trouble figuring out what polygonal parameters were used by the author. They are vaguely identified as areas, and are too big to be census tracts or counties.</p> 
      <p>I also thought about how my perception about what message the map communicates transformed after reading the accompanying text. It contextualized the map within the current debates and scholarship that exists about the intersection between wealth and public health. In some ways, this map tells a nuanced story that challenges us to pose complex public policy questions.</p>

      <a href= "http://googletrends.github.io/iframe-scaffolder/#/view?urls=Thanksgiving%202015%7Chttps:%252F%252Fgoogledataorg.cartodb.com%252Fu%252Fgoogledata%252Fviz%252Fbf595f4c-7381-11e5-9ec5-42010a14800c%252Fembed_map&active=0&sharing=1&autoplay=0&loop=1&layout=narrative&theme=red&title=A%20day%20in%20the%20life:%20US%20Thanksgiving%20on%20Google%20Flights&description=The%20day%20before%20Thanksgiving%202015%20shown%20in%20US%20domestic%20and%20international%20air%20travel%20booked%20with%20Google%20Flights">Google Thanksgiving Flights</a>

      <p>One visualization that I found online was a map generated by Google to show the amount of people that were flying around the United States on Thanksgiving. The data is represented in a torque map and shows different airlanes color coded flying across the United States. I thought this was very interesting and effective why to display this data set because it shows were these flights are taking off and were they are landing.</p>
      <p> A map like this can show you how diverse the United States is and how someone can have family members living across the country. This map also shows flights leaving the United States and going overseas into different countries as well and this information is very useful because it shows you what types of airlines actually travel overseas. I was very impressed with how this data was represented in this map and I thought this map made it very easy to understand where certain airline companies fly and it was also very interesting to see where their final destination will be.</p>

      <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/11/upshot/for-the-poor-geography-is-life-and-death.html" target="_blank"> The Rich Live Longer Everywhere. For the Poor, Geography Matters</a> 
      <p> This Monday, the NY Times published <q>The Rich Live Longer Everywhere. For the Poor, Geography Matters</q> and had a powerful visualization mapping out the life expectancy in relation with income. The data was supplied from the JAMA article <q>The Association Between Income and Life Expectancy in the United States, 2001-2014</q> which was published a day before According to the study design from the JAMA: Income data for the US population were obtained from 1.4 billion deidentified tax records between 1999 and 2014, mortality data were obtained from Social Security Administration death records.</p> 
      <p> Due to the fact that the visualization itself was interactive, you were able to see the data clearly as it mapped out life expectancies. However, it should be noted that the visualization clearly states <q>Life expectancy of 40-year-olds with household incomes below $28,000, adjusted for race</q>. Though it was seamless to look at the different life expectancies in various parts of the US on the map, it only reflected on a certain household income which could not be altered. Though, the data is then reorganized in a tabular format with more income levels (plus various correlations) and their corresponding life expectancies.</p>
