#Let's Create a Map Using the Data You Found
###http://cartodb.com


---

#Assignment - Visualization
##Complete the visualization started in class with data from an open data portal. Style the map in CartoDB and have prepared a short descriptive text (1-2 paragraphs) on where you found the data, what you did to visualize the data, and any thoughts on what you've created. 

##Write your text into the editor and have it ready for class on Wednesday along with a link to your visualization.

#Assignment - Visualization Critique 1
##Find an interesting or visually compelling visualization online and write 2-3 paragraphs on the visualization, discussing the data source(s), the visual style, and how well the data was represented. Feel free to use the visualization resources listed above. 

##Write your text into the editor and have it ready for class on Wednesday.
